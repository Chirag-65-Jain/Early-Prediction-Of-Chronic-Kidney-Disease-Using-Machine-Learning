# Early-Prediction-Of-Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Using-Machine-Learning
<hr>

### _Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) is a critical condition caused due to kidney malfunction or kidney malignancy. Early prediction of such diseases will help address the issue at an early stage and suppress it as much as possible_

This Project aims to develop a model that can predict CKD at an early stage with good recall scores and accuracy.
Throughout the training, 4 models were trained alongside each other. The model with the best result was selected.
